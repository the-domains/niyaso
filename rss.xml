            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Build a Solid Drinking Library</h1><p>Are there places I like as much as great bars? Yes: great bookshops. And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6f3c3486b0667a20b93cfb5b648ccf57af028336.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There & Back Again: A Cross-Country Epic</h1><p>It's usually late February or early March when I load up my vehicle with tools of photographic wonder to embark on a journey from Asheville, NC into the unknown and across the U.S. Destination: Las Vegas. WPPI to be exact, where I have been an educator there since 2002.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8b9656e1adc0b7119ac419bcd54748f5ecfdf92.jpg"></article>]]></description>
